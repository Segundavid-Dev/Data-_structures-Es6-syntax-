## MODERN JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX - DATA STRUCTURES

This Repo will contain my continued learning process in BASIC JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX but with a focus on more modern javascript (ES6)

- Built in Javascript Data Structures:

  - Objects
  - Maps
  - Arrays

- Modern ES6 plus operators

  - Destructuring
  - Optional Chaining

- Working with Strings

This will provide a solid foundation in my Javascript Software Engineering Journey ðŸŽ‰
